# TODO

* Vis part-seg and cloth seg
* Vis and compare algo (vis notebook)
* Read train script
* <s> Do evaluation on easy medium hard </s>
* STN [https://github.com/WarBean/tps_stn_pytorch](https://github.com/WarBean/tps_stn_pytorch)
* Evaluate VITON, CV-VTON and ACGPN (use pretrained models), atleast 2/3
* https://github.com/minar09/cp-vton-plus


# Train model
`python train.py --name experiment_name`

Copy checkpoint folder `experiment_name` to ACGPN_inference

# Run inference
`python test.py --load_pretrain ./checkpoints/experiment_name`

# Compute FID
Install using `pip install pytorch-fid`.
Run `python -m pytorch_fid path/to/dataset1 path/to/dataset2` to get FID scores.

# Reference
* SSIM and FID scores computed using [https://github.com/Po-Hsun-Su/pytorch-ssim](https://github.com/Po-Hsun-Su/pytorch-ssim) and [https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid)
